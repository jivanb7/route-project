// Connect the morgan middleware for logging information about requests and responses:

// Add the cookie-parser middleware for parsing cookies and the express.json middleware for parsing JSON bodies of requests with Content-Type of "application/json".
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.json());

// Add several security middlewares:

// 1. Only allow CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in development using the cors middleware because the React frontend will be served from a different server than the Express server. CORS isn't needed in production since all of our React and Express resources will come from the same origin.
// 2. Enable better overall security with the helmet middleware (for more on what helmet is doing, see helmet on the npm registry). React is generally safe at mitigating XSS (i.e., Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, but do be sure to research how to protect your users from such attacks in React when deploying a large production application. Now add the crossOriginResourcePolicy to the helmet middleware with a policy of cross-origin. This will allow images with URLs to render in deployment.
// 3. Add the csurf middleware and configure it to use cookies.

// Security Middleware
if (!isProduction) {
  // enable cors only in development
  app.use(cors());
}

// helmet helps set a variety of headers to better secure your app
app.use(
  helmet.crossOriginResourcePolicy({
    policy: "cross-origin",
  })
);
